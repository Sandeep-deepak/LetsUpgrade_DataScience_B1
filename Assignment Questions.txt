** Day 1: **

#Questions 1: 
Given the following jumbled word, OBANWRI guess the correct English word. 
A. RANIBOW 
B. RAINBOW 
C. BOWRANI 
D. ROBWANI 

#Questions 2: 
Write a program which prints “LETS UPGRADE”. (Please note that you have to 
print in ALL CAPS as given) 

#Questions 3: 
Write a program that takes cost price and selling price as input and displays whether the transaction is a 
Profit or a Loss or Neither. 
INPUT FORMAT 
The first line contains the cost price. 
The second line contains the selling price. 
OUTPUT FORMAT 
Print "Profit" if the transaction is a profit or "Loss" if it is a loss. If it is neither 
profit nor loss, print "Neither". (You must not have quotes in your output) 

#Questions 4: 
Write a program that takes an amount in Euros as input. You need to find its equivalent in 
Rupees and display it. Assume 1 Euro equals Rs. 80. 
Please note that you are expected to stick to the given input and output 
format as in sample test cases. Please don't add any extra lines such as 
'Enter a number', etc. 
Your program should take only one number as input and display the output.

** Day 2: **

#Questions 1: 
Create an empty list. Accept 10 numbers from the user and append to it the list if it is an even number. 

#Questions 2: 
Create a notebook on LIST COMPREHENSION. This exercise is to put you in a Self learning mode 

#Questions 3: 
You have seen in the videos how powerful dictionary data structure is. 
In this assignment, given a number n, you have to write a program that generates a dictionary d which 
contains (i, i*i), where i is from 1 to n (both included). 
Then you have to just print this dictionary d. 
Example: 
Input: 4 
will give output as 
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16} 
Input Format: 
Take the number n in a single line. 
Output Format: 
Print the dictionary d in a single line. 
Example: 
Input: 
8 
Output: 
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64} 

#Questions 4: 
There is a robot which wants to go the charging point to charge itself. 
The robot moves in a 2-D plane from the original point (0,0). The robot can 
move toward UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT with given steps. 
The trace of robot movement is shown as the following: 
UP 5 
DOWN 3 
LEFT 3 
RIGHT 2 
Then, the output of the program should be: 
2 
The numbers after the direction are steps. 
Write a program to compute the distance between the current position after 
a sequence of movement and original point. If the distance is a float, then 
just print the nearest integer (use round() function for that and then convert 
it into an integer). 
Input Format: 
The first line of the input contains a number n which implies the number of 
directions to be given. 
The next n lines contain the direction and the step separated by a space. 
Output Format: 
Print the distance from the original position to the current position. 
Example: 
Input:  
4 
UP 5 
DOWN 3 
LEFT 3 
RIGHT 2 
Output:  
2
